i. Project Description:
This project aims to create a playlist generator based on the user's mood and preferred music genre. Users choose an emotion and genre, and the system generates a custom playlist, with the option to save it to Spotify.

ii. Algorithm / Library / Methods:
I'll use the Spotify Web API for song data and a recommendation system that categorizes songs by mood. Possible tools include NLP for mood interpretation and clustering algorithms for matching songs to emotions.

iii. Data:
The project will use Spotifyâ€™s metadata (tempo, energy, genre, etc.) and mood-tagged song datasets.

iv. Expected Outcome:
A code that creates mood-based playlists with a direct link to save them to Spotify.
