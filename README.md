i. Project Description:
This project aims to create a song recommender based on the user's mood and preferred music genre. Users choose an emotion and genre, and the system generates a list of ten songs including artists which fit the specifics you filled in.

ii. Algorithm / Library / Methods:
I'll use a database with over 30,000 songs, including artists, moods, genres, etc., to create a song recommendation system. Once filling in your mood and genre you would like to listen to, the code will pick out 10 random songs for you which fit your selected options.

iii. Data:
The project will use a dataset called Spotify Tracks Dataset on Kaggle. This dataset includes data such as energy, genre, duration, danceability, etc.

iv. Expected Outcome:
A code that gives 10 songs based on your mood and favourite genre.
